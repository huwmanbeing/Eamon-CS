4.4    ARTIFACT TYPES

There are 13 types of recognized artifacts. You are also allowed to enter a 
value of 14, 15, or 16 for your own special types.  All USER types are treated 
as type 1 by Eamon CS unless you add your own code. Creating new artifact 
types is very uncommon as most any type you'll need is already pre-programmed 
and it is strongly suggested that you stay within the usual types. The types 
are as follows:

 Type            Format         Type                  Format
 ----------------------         ---------------------------- 
  0. Gold...............0        9. Edible...............4
  1. Treasure...........0       10. Bound Monster........7  
  2. Weapon.............1       11. Wearable.............8
  3. Magic Weapon.......1       12. Disguised Monster....9
  4. Container..........2       13. Dead body............10
  5. Lightable..........3       14. Undefined, User......0
  6. Drinkable..........4       15. Undefined, User......0
  7. Readable...........5       16. Undefined, User......0
  8. Door/Gate..........6

All of the formats have the same information in the Artifact object, including
Value, Weight, Location, etc.  The Type and remaining format fields are stored
in one or more ArtifactCategory objects, referenced by the Artifact.  Format #0
is all USER fields, the rest of the format fields 1-4 contain the following.

  Format 1             Format 2               Format 3
