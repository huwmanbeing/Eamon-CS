	/// This defines the concept of a database table in Eamon CS.  It is integral to the storage of all
	/// game-related records (rooms, artifacts, monsters, etc), both in memory and in filesystem.  The
	/// <see cref="IDatabase"/> interface exposes a set of IDbTables, one for each record type derived
	/// from <see cref="IGameBase"/>.  The database table class heirarchy is derived from the abstract
	/// class <see cref="Game.DataStorage.Generic.DbTable{T}"/>.  If you look inside the various game
	/// .XML files you will see that they consist of the serialized concretes of IDbTable mentioned
	/// below in the See Also section.
