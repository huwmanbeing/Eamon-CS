The Eamon Deluxe subdirectory is replicated so as to include as many EDX license-related files as
possible.  This is done to satisfy the requirements of the GPL license.  

The Eamon CS project is distinct from Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe and the inclusion of
this subdirectory hierarchy is not meant to imply a relationship between the two.
