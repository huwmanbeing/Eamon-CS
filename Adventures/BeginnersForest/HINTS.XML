                <Simple value="2. Sometimes items may be in a room but won't show up until you Examine them.  Pay close attention to all descriptions.  Note:  Look only repeats the room description and -nothing- else.  Use Examine to, well, examine things." />
                <Simple value="3. Before you can manipulate items that are inside of other items, you must Remove them from that item.  There is no &quot;Remove All&quot; command, but if you Attack a (breakable) container, all of its contents will be emptied to the floor and you can &quot;Get All&quot;." />
                <Simple value="4. Type Save and a number for a desired save position to Quick Save (save without having to verify).  Adding a description will rename that slot.

                <Simple value="8. The Power spell has been known to have strange and marvelous effects in many adventures.  When all else fails (or just for fun) try &quot;Power&quot;." />
