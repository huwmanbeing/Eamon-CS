Eamon CS requires a .NET Standard 2.0 compliant runtime; for example, .NET 4.6.1+ on Windows and Mono 5.2.0+ on Unix.  The .NET Core 2.0 runtime is also required.  All modern Windows platforms come with the latest .NET runtime installed, but for Unix you may have to do a manual Mono install depending on your distribution.

Eamon CS Mobile currently runs on devices using Android 4.0 through 7.1.
